Core Java code practice from the Telusko Java Spring Framework course on Udemy.

## ðŸ“˜ About This Repository

This repository contains Core Java practice programs from the Udemy course [Java Spring Framework 6, Spring Boot 3, Spring AI]

Some code snippets are based on the instructor's examples for learning purposes. In several cases, Iâ€™ve:
- Rewritten the code in my own way
- Added my own variations
- Structured it into different folders for practice

This repo is for **personal learning and skill development**, not for redistribution or commercial use.
